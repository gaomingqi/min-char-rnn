I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
This is Mummy Pig.
And this is Daddy Pig.
Peppa Pig.
Potato City.
Peppa and her family are going to Potato City. 
What is Potato City, Mummy? 
It is a theme park, Peppa. 
Where the magic of vegetables never ends. 
It sounds a bit boring. 
It will be fun. Potato City, here we come.
Here we are. 
The family have arrived at a field of potatoes. 
Is this Potato City? 
It must be. 
And it looks like we pick the right day to visit. 
There are no crowds.
Are you sure this is the right place, Daddy Pig? 
It just looks like a farmer's field to me. 
Excuse me, is this Potato City? 
No, that's Potato City. 
It isn't quite what I was expecting. 
It is fantastic! 
How many tickets? 
Two adults and two children please, Miss Rabbit.
